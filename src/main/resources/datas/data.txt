Abstract
Background
Self-generated thoughts (SGTs), such as during mind-wandering, occupy much of our waking 
life. Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are less in the “here and now” and 
prone to rumination. Few studies have looked at SGTs in depression using experience sampling 
methods and no study has so far investigated the specific contents of depressive SGTs and how 
they vary from one time point to another.
Methods
MDD patients (n =25) and matched healthy controls (n = 26) performed an established mind 
wandering task, involving non-demanding number discriminations. Intermittent probe questions 
ask for participants’ current SGTs, that is, how off-task the thoughts are, how positive or 
negative, self- or other-related, and past- or future-oriented.
Results
Multi-level modeling revealed that MDD patients engaged in more mind wandering than healthy 
controls. Their SGTs were predominantly negative and less positive, more self-related and pastoriented. Strongest predictor of depressive SGT was the decreased positive valence of thoughts. 
MDD patients’ future and past-oriented thoughts were particularly more negative compared to 
healthy controls. Within MDD patients, the less positively valenced thoughts they had and the 
less variable these thoughts were, the more depressive symptoms they showed. 
Limitation
No other measures of rumination and worry were used.
Conclusion
MDD patients show a very specific SGT pattern, possibly reflecting ruminative and anxious 
thoughts. This SGT pattern in depression might represent a useful state marker and even
constitute an etiological factor of this debilitating disease, considering the importance of current 
SGT on and individual’s cognitive processes and affective states.
1. Introduction
Self-generated thoughts (SGTs) arise independently of external stimulation through the 
environment, and comprise experiences such as mind-wandering, day-dreaming, rumination and 
planning (Smallwood, 2013). It is known that SGT forms a crucial part of human mental activity, 
occupying up to 50% of our waking mind (Kane et al., 2007; Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010). 
Mind wandering occurs particularly when attentional and cognitive demands in relation to the
external environment are low (e.g. Smallwood et al., 2004). Some studies have linked SGT such 
as mind-wandering to negative mood and unhappiness (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010; 
Stawarczyk et al., 2013), recent findings, however, suggest that it is crucial to consider ‘where 
the mind wanders’ and to look more specifically at the content of SGTs. For example, in healthy 
individuals, past-focused thoughts seem to be related to a reduction in positive mood, more 
depressive symptoms and increased cortisol levels after stress, while future-focused thoughts 
lead to an increase in positive mood and an attenuated stress response (Baird et al., 2011; Engert 
et al., 2014; Ruby et al., 2013a; Smallwood and O'Connor, 2011; Smallwood et al., 2007). Thus,
SGT seems to represent a heterogeneous mental phenomenon with variable effects on human 
cognition, affect and behavior (Andrews‐Hanna et al., 2014).
Patients with depression are known to show considerable difficulties with staying in the 
“here and now”. Investigations have demonstrated that MDD patients tend to engage in 
maladaptive SGTs in the form of excessive rumination and worry (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991, 2000; 
Watkins, 2008). Depressive rumination has been characterized as a mode of responding to 
distress which involves repetitively and passively focusing on symptoms of distress and on the 
possible causes and consequences of these symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000). Worry, in 
contrast, has been described as a chain of negative uncontrollable thoughts and images, 
constituting an attempt to engage in problem-solving on issues with an uncertain outcome
(Borkovec et al., 1983). While rumination and worry tend to correlate and some similar features 
such as their repetitive nature, they have also been found to be statistically distinguishable
(Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008). It has thus been proposed that rumination is more past and 
present oriented, focused on issues of self-worth, meaning and loss, whereas worry seems to be 
future-oriented, focused on anticipating threats (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008; Watkins, 2008). 
While both rumination and worry have been associated with depressive symptoms, rumination 
seems to be more strongly related to depression (Hendriks et al., 2014; Hong, 2007). In MDD, 
rumination seems to represent a vulnerability marker for developing the disorder, and also shows
a relation to the duration of MDD episodes and relapse probability (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 
2008). According to the cognitive model of depression, adverse early life events lead to 
internalization of negative self-referential schemas that subsequently bias information processing, 
in how stimuli are encoded, organized and retrieved (Disner et al., 2011). Therefore, these 
negative self-referential schemas might bias thoughts towards rumination of negative past 
experiences in depressive patients.
Previous research on rumination and worry in depression has been largely based on 
questionnaire and induction methods, which both have considerable limitations and lack 
ecological validity. Questionnaire methods rely heavily on retrospection which is often impaired 
in psychiatric populations. Most induction methods prompt participants towards rumination 
about certain subjects (thinking e.g. about the long-term goals you have set), which then is 
compared to distraction inductions, asking the participants to focus on non-self-relevant images 
(Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1993). However without no-intervention control conditions, the 
effects between the two different conditions are difficult to disentangle. More critically these 
induction methods do not capture momentary online thoughts. In contrast growing research on 
SGTs in healthy individuals suggests that if one wants to make more objective claims about the 
wandering mind in health or in depression one ought to investigate SGTs using online experience 
sampling measures. Such online-measures of SGTs would allow picking up disease specific SGT 
patterns in the moment when they actually occur, and are particularly useful in depression 
research as ecological momentary assessment avoids the recall bias toward negative memories 
and also allows for better generalization to real life. To our knowledge only one study looked at 
online SGTs in clinically depressed participants (Ottaviani et al., 2014). Using an experience 
sampling method this study categorized SGTs in depression as either normal mind wandering, on 
task thoughts or perseverative cognition, linking the latter to autonomic inflexibility in lower 
heart-rate variability. No study however has so far tried to objectively decompose the specific 
SGT contents in clinical depression, regarding the previously established temporal (past or future 
oriented), social (self or other related), and emotional (negative or positive) dimensions of SGT 
(Engert et al., 2014; Ruby et al., 2013a; Ruby et al., 2013b). From a clinical perspective 
identifying the specific SGT pattern in depression seems of great interest, as such SGT pattern 
could function as a state marker of depression, which could potentially then be utilized as 
measure of disease progression and therapeutic change, as well as helping better differentiation 
of mental disorders. In addition it is unknown how these SGT contents in MDD patients relative 
to healthy controls vary over time, which could function as a good indicator of the repetitiveness 
of thoughts, inherent in rumination and also worry. This study thus aimed to comprehensively 
investigate the space of SGTs in depression in terms of amount, content and variability.
Based of clinical observation and description disordered thoughts in depression have 
been commonly conceptualized as rumination and worry. Such disordered thoughts in depression 
can however, considering the recent findings in mind wandering research possibly more 
accurately be described by pathological SGTs in depression. In this study we thus aimed to 
specifically investigate the online SGT contents and their variability in a sample of clinically 
depressed patients. We used an established non-demanding choice reaction time task (CRT) that 
allows spontaneous SGTs in participants. During this task participants are asked at random time 
points, first, how much they were on task, and, secondly, about the specific content of their 
thoughts (Engert et al., 2014; Ruby et al., 2013a; Ruby et al., 2013b), such as questions asking if
their thoughts were focused on certain temporal epochs (future or past), involved different 
referents (self or other) and varied in valence (negative or positive). This task is particularly 
useful as an objective online measure of the amount and specific content of SGTs, but also of 
their variability over time, as participants are asked about the SGTs repeatedly throughout the 
task. One index of thought variability is the fluctuation of thought ratings from one thought 
probe to the next, computed as the squared successive difference in ratings, which has been an 
established method in experience sampling studies (Ebner-Priemer et al., 2007; Jahng et al., 2008; 
Skirrow et al., 2014; Trull et al., 2008). Another index of variability represents the extremity of 
the thought ratings, calculated as the squared difference of each rating from the mean for that 
variable.
We first hypothesized that MDD patients relative to healthy controls would generally 
show more mind wandering, that is engage in more SGTs, being less in the ‘here and now’, and 
that these stimulus independent thoughts would be more negative, self, and past related in 
accordance with the cognitive model of depression and findings on increased rumination in 
depression. Secondly, we also hypothesized that MDD patients would think more about negative 
future events, possibly pointing to their tendency to engage in stronger worrying compared to 
healthy controls. Thirdly we expected that MDD patients would also show less variability and 
more rigid thought patterns compared to healthy controls, capturing the repetitive nature of their 
thoughts. Lastly we expected a relation between symptom severity and specific patterns in SGTs 
and their variability in depression. 
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
25 patients with depression were recruited through the inpatient clinic of the CharitéUniversitätsmedizin Berlin, or were referred to us by specialized clinicians (see Table 1). 26
healthy control (HC) participants matched to the patients in terms of years of education, age, and 
gender with no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders were recruited by public notices 
and from project databases of the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Participants were assessed 
for mental disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2000) and a diagnosis of acute state of depression was confirmed with 
no other primary diagnoses. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, 
Hautzinger et al., 1995), and were also assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Sale 
(HAMD-17, Hamilton, 1960). Additionally, participants completed a measure of crystallized 
intelligence (Wortschatztest, WST, a vocabulary test part of the HAWIE-R, the German 
adaptation of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Schmidt and Metzler, 1992). All MDD 
patients except one were on medication (see Table 2). No patient was medicated with 
benzodiazepines for at least 48 hours. Exclusion criteria included any comorbid axis I disorder, 
current neurological disorder, substance abuse within 6 months before study participation, 
diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder. None of the 
patients had a history of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The study was approved by the local 
research ethics committee (Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin) and written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants.
2.2. CRT Task
We used an established mind wandering paradigm that probes off-task thoughts during a 
choice reaction time task (Baird et al., 2012; Ruby et al., 2013a; Smallwood et al., 2013) and 
assessed the content of the participants’ thoughts on six different dimensions 1) past, 2) future, 3) 
self, 4) other, 5) negative valence and 6) positive valence (e.g. Engert et al., 2014; Ruby et al., 
2013a). A series of black digits between 1 and 8 was presented. One sixth of the digits was 
presented in red color signaling participants that they should indicate via button press if this 
number was odd or even. Black digits were presented for 1000 ms and red digits for 2000 ms. 
Responses had to be made while the colored digits were still present on the screen. Stimuli were 
separated by a fixation cross of variable duration (2200–4400 ms). 
The number of thought probes and their presentation were randomly determined (Ruby et al., 
2013a), to avoid any expectancy biases, and thus sampling SGTs in the most unconstrained way 
(number of probes between four and nine). Participants were asked to rate their current thoughts 
using a nine-point Likert scale on several dimensions including how much their thoughts were 1) 
past-oriented, 2) future-oriented, 3) self-related, 4) other-related, 5) negatively valenced and 6) 
positively valenced and 7) how much off task their thoughts were at that point in time. 
Additionally, they rated their current mood (i.e. how positive and how negative they felt).
Importantly healthy controls and MDD patients did not differ in terms of accuracy (healthy 
controls: 87.2%, MDD patients: 86.4%) and reaction time (healthy controls: 882.29 ms, MDD 
patients: 923.62 ms) on the CRT task (more detail reported in the results section). The entire task 
lasted approximately 14 min. Stimuli were presented using E-prime 2.0 (Psychology Software 
Tools, Inc., Sharpsburg, PA, USA).
2.3. Data analysis
For the main analyses, we used multi-level models because they take correlated observations 
within individuals into account and perform well with missing data or unequal numbers of data 
points within individuals (Jahng et al., 2008). Linear mixed models were calculated in SPSS 
version 22 with the number of the particular sampling point within the session (e.g., sample 5) as 
covariate and with a random intercept. Sampling point was used as a covariate within the models 
to account for different numbers of sampling points between the participants. In addition to the 
rating level (e.g. to what extent was a certain thought negative or self-related), we investigated 
two indices of variability, i.e., fluctuations and extremity in ratings. To obtain a measure of how 
much individuals fluctuate in their single SGT ratings from one thought probe to the next, we 
calculated squared successive differences, which has been established in experience sampling 
studies (Ebner-Priemer et al., 2007; Jahng et al., 2008; Skirrow et al., 2014; Trull et al., 2008).
Fluctuation scores were calculated for each SGT dimension separately. To obtain a measure of 
how extreme the individual ratings were, we calculated the squared difference of each rating 
from the total sample mean (including healthy controls and MDD patients) for that variable. In 
contrast to the fluctuations, this does not take into account how big successive changes are, but 
rather indicates how much a certain rating differs from the “norm”. As a measure of effect size 
for the central main effects and interaction effects Omega-squared (ω2
) was calculated by taking 
the difference from 1 and the variance of the residuals of the full model divided by the variance 
of the residuals of the model without the respective fixed factor of interest (Xu, 2003). A value 
of ω2
= .010 represents a small effect size, a value of ω2
= .059 indicates a medium effect size and 
a value of ω2
=.138 represents a large effect size (Kirk, 1996). In a first step, differences between 
MDD patients and HCs in ratings levels, fluctuations in ratings, and extremity in ratings (see 
below for details) were subjected to multi-level models as described above. In a second step we 
tested for group differences and in particular interrelations of the different content dimensions of 
SGT, on which healthy controls and MDD patients were found to differ. This allowed us to 
investigate whether certain SGTs were more strongly correlated with one another in MDD 
patients compared to healthy controls. Finally in a third step, we investigated how symptom 
severity in healthy controls and MDD patients related to the different SGT measures (rating, 
fluctuation, extremity). Symptom severity in healthy controls and MDD patients might relate to 
very specific SGTs. In the case of healthy controls such SGTs might represent a vulnerability 
factor towards the development of depression.
3. Results
3.1. Performance
Independent samples t-tests showed no significant differences between healthy controls and 
MDD patients in accuracy (t(49) = -0.13, p = .894; healthy controls: 87.2 % ± 17.3, MDD 
patients: 86.4 % ± 24.7) or reaction times (t(49) = 1.26, p = .212; healthy controls: 882.29 ms 
±106.24, MDD patients: 923.62 ms ± 126.74) in the CRT.
3.2. Mood probes
Multilevel models revealed that MDD patients showed elevated levels of negative and 
decreased levels of positive mood (see Table 3 and Fig. 1 Supplemental Material). The 
fluctuations and extremity of the mood ratings were not significantly different between groups.
3.3. Thought probes
3.3.1. Rating levels
Multilevel models revealed that MDD patients show significantly increased off-task 
thoughts, relative to the healthy controls (see Fig. 1 and Table 3). Regarding the particular SGT 
contents, MDD patients reported more negative and less positive, as well as more past- and selfrelated thoughts compared to healthy controls. MDD patients also engaged in marginally more 
future-oriented SGTs. Number of sampling points (“Sample”), was included as a covariate in all 
analyses. Non-significant results of the number of sampling points particularly for fluctuation 
and extremity suggest that variability measures were not as strongly influenced by the number of 
sampling points, thus did not change as much over the course of the experiment, as the ratings 
themselves. Including current mood as a covariate showed significant relations between mood 
and thought valence, but did not change the group differences in positive (b = 7.800, S.E. = 
2.940, p = .010) and negative thoughts (b = -15.4435, S.E. = 4.124, p = .001). There were no 
group differences in the amount of other-related thoughts. While healthy controls had more 
positive thoughts than negative thoughts (t(25) = -4.022, p < .001), MDD patients had
marginally more negative thoughts than positive thoughts (t(24) = 1.981, p = .059).
3.3.2. Variability
There were no significant differences between the groups in extremity of SGTs (see 
Table 3). There was however a marginally significant group difference in fluctuations of pastrelated thoughts, with MDD patients showing less fluctuating past-related SGTs (see Table 3).
3.3.3. SGT contents as predictors of MDD
Looking at what SGT content was the most accurate in distinguishing between MDD 
patients and healthy controls a stepwise logistic regression was performed on the two groups, 
with the six SGT contents as predictors (past, future, other, self, negative, positive). The results 
showed that the amount of positive thoughts was most discriminative between the two groups (B
= -0.45, Wald = 59. 05, p < .001, Nagelkerke R square = .323).
3.3.4. Interrelations between SGT contents in MDD patients and healthy controls
Looking specifically at interrelations of the different content dimensions of SGT, multilevel models were used on the SGT contents in which MDD patients and healthy controls were 
found to differ (self, past, negative, positive, see 3.3.1). These analyses were run to investigate 
whether certain SGTs tended to interrelate more strongly in MDD patients relative to healthy 
controls. Each SGT content was used as a covariate to investigate interrelation with another SGT 
(as dependent variable), while group was used as an independent factor (healthy controls vs 
MDD patients). This resulted in twelve separate models, with only the significant models 
reported in Table 4. In particular, it was found that MDD patients’ temporal thoughts of past and 
future were significantly more negatively valenced in comparison to the healthy controls (see Fig.
2 and Table 4), suggesting a stronger preoccupation with negative past and negative future 
events. In contrast positive thoughts in healthy controls were more past-related compared to 
MDD patients. In addition past-oriented thoughts were more self-related in MDD patients 
compared to healthy controls.
3.5.Relation of SGT variables to symptom severity
3.5.1. MDD patients
To test for a relation of the observed effects with symptom severity in the MDD group, 
we ran two separate liner-mixed models with BDI and Hamilton scores as covariates. Both 
symptom severity measures, BDI and Hamilton scores showed a significant positive correlation 
(healthy controls: r = 0.68, p < 0.01; MDD patients: r = 0.43, p = 0.03). BDI was a marginal 
predictor for the amount of mind wandering in general (b = 0.942, S.E. = 0.500, p = 0.071). 
Looking specifically at SGT contents, BDI was a predictor of increased levels of past-related 
thoughts (b = 1.109, S.E. = 0.497, p = 0.045), and a marginally significant predictor of decreased 
positive valence (b = -0.863, S.E. = 0.420, p = 0.050). Hamilton scores were a significant 
predictor of future-related thoughts (b = 4.271, S.E. = 0.623, p < 0.001) and negative valence (b 
= 2.369, S.E. = 1.293, p = 0.080). These findings suggest that more severe symptoms are 
associated with an increase in specific SGT contents. .
Relating symptom severity to SGT fluctuations, BDI scores were found to be a predictor 
of the fluctuations in self-related thoughts (b = -39,527, S.E. = 14.031, p = 0.006) and 
fluctuations in negative (b = -18,634, S.E. = 8.369, p = 0.027) and positive valence (b = -20,029, 
S.E. = 7.460, p = 0.008). Hamilton scores were found to be a predictor of the fluctuations in selfrelated thoughts (b = -74,202, S.E. = 34.163, p = 0.032) and fluctuations positive valence (b = -
54,834, S.E. = 18.460, p = 0.004). These findings suggest that, the more severe the depressive 
symptoms in MDD patients were the less variable the reported experience of specific SGTs is in 
the course of the experiment was.
Relating symptom severity to SGT extremity, BDI was found to be a predictor of 
extremity in past-related thoughts (b = 34,396, S.E. = 713.425, p = 0.015). Hamilton was a 
predictor of extremity in future-related thoughts (b = 91,014, S.E. = 27.059, p = 0.001).
3.5.2. Healthy controls
Another interesting question was how depressive symptomatology in healthy controls
related to SGTs, possibly indicating that certain SGTs can indicate a vulnerability to developing
depression. BDI was found to be a marginal predictor of the amount of past-related thoughts (b = 
1.492, S.E. = 0.775, p = 0.067). Hamilton scores were also found to be a significant predictor of 
the amount of past-related thoughts (b = 4.025, S.E. = 1.718, p = 0.023.
Symptom severity was found to be unrelated to fluctuations in SGTs in healthy controls. 
BDI (b = -54.687, S.E. = 16.886, p = 0.001), as well as Hamilton (b = -70.058, S.E. = 41.067, p 
= 0.090) were found to be a predictor of extremity in the amount of general mind wandering.
4. Discussion
In this study we aimed to investigate thinking patterns related to mind wandering in clinical 
depression relative to healthy controls using an objective online-measure, a mind wandering 
laboratory task that probes the amount and specific content of task-unrelated thoughts in the 
moment in which they occur. More specifically the content of thoughts was assessed on 
following six dimensions: 1) past, 2) future, 3) self, 4) other, 5) negative valence and 6) positive 
valence (Engert et al., 2014; Ruby et al., 2013a; Ruby et al., 2013b). In addition to typically used 
average scores of STG frequencies, we also looked here at fluctuation and extremity of SGTs as 
a measure of variability over time. We hypothesized that MDD patients relative to healthy 
controls would engage in more mind wandering, showing a specific SGT pattern possibly related 
to rumination and worry. In addition we expected that the amount and also the variability of 
depression specific SGTs would relate to symptom severity.
As hypothesized MDD patients engaged in a greater amount of SGTs compared to healthy 
controls, showing more off-task mind wandering, being less in the “here and now”. The SGT 
pattern in MDD patients relative to healthy controls was characterized by significantly more selfand past-related thoughts that were more negative and less positive in valence. In particular,
MDD patients’ past-related thoughts were strongly coupled to negatively valenced SGTs. These 
findings suggest that distorted thought processes in depression can be very well captured and 
described in online depressive mind wandering. This specific depressive SGT pattern might in 
part relate to pathological rumination about negative past events, which is commonly found to be 
increased in depression (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991, 2000). Supporting this suggestion, the “feelings 
of guilt” item of the Hamilton scale including questions about rumination was particularly 
associated with past-related thoughts in MDD patients (see Supplemental Information). This 
SGT pattern is also in accordance with the three proposed elements of rumination (Disner et al., 
2011): altered emotion and memory processing, increased self-referential processing, and 
decreased top-down inhibition of these processes.
Interestingly, the strongest predictor of depressive SGT was the positive valence of the 
thoughts. This is in accordance with some findings showing that the absence of positive affect
might be actually more indicative of the depressive state, as increased negative affect is shared 
by most mood and anxiety disorders (Watson et al., 1988). Further, symptom severity also 
related with the amount of positive thoughts within the group of the MDD patients, as well as 
their variance. This suggests that the low and flat positive valence of thoughts plays a crucial
functional role in depression and its severity. Findings of decreased positive affect in response to 
rewards and abnormal functioning of reward sensitive brain areas such as the nucleus accumbens
in depression (Heller et al., 2009), might be seen as further support. In the case of the healthy 
controls depressive symptoms were related to increased amount of past-related thoughts as 
previously reported (Ruby et al., 2013a; Smallwood and O'Connor, 2011; Smallwood et al.,
2007). Past-related thoughts might therefore represent a vulnerability factor for depression, 
possibly related to a ruminative response style, which has been shown to be associated with onset, 
maintenance and reoccurrence of depressive episodes (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000; NolenHoeksema et al., 2008). 
While MDD patients only marginally engaged in more future-related thoughts, their 
future-oriented thoughts were significantly more negative than in healthy controls. This could be 
interpreted as a SGT pattern of worry, and indeed the somatic anxiety scale of the Hamilton scale
was positively related to future thoughts in MDD patients, lending support for this suggestion
(see Supplemental Information). Interestingly future-related thoughts in healthy controls have 
mostly been associated with adaptive and beneficial effects such as increasing subsequent 
positive mood and attenuated cortisol levels at baseline and after a stressor (Engert et al., 2014; 
Ruby et al., 2013a). It has also been suggested that future-oriented SGT is instrumental in 
autobiographical planning and consolidation (Baird et al., 2011; Smallwood et al., 2011). Our 
results do show however that in the case of clinical depression future thoughts are negative and 
potentially maladaptive being related to worry that exacerbates the depressive state.
In this study we also looked at SGT variability over time given the multiple sampling 
points of the thought probes. We used two indices of SGT variability, namely the fluctuation of 
the SGT ratings, and the extremity of the SGT ratings, which both can be seen as a good 
indicator of the repetitiveness or perseverance of thoughts, such as present in depressive 
rumination and worry. Significant group differences were only found for the fluctuation of pastrelated thoughts, with MDD patients showing less variability in past-related thoughts compared 
to healthy controls. In addition, symptom severity in MDD patients related to fluctuations in 
SGTs. Particularly, the stronger the symptoms that the MDD patients portrayed, the less self-
related, positive and negative thoughts fluctuated. Similarly symptom severity in MDD patients 
was associated the extremity of future-related SGTs. In general these findings suggest that the 
stronger the depressive symptoms portrayed by MDD patients, the more rigid certain SGTs are 
over time. In particular the less variable the positive valence of such SGTs is, the more repetitive
and perseverative certain thoughts and the corresponding affect are. Increasing inflexibility in 
SGTs in depression might be associated with reported cognitive inflexibility in depression
(Altamirano et al., 2010; Joormann et al., 2011; Whitmer and Gotlib, 2013), due to serotonergic 
dysregulation within prefrontal cortex (Clarke et al., 2004).
From a clinical point of view, identifying SGT patterns of MDD and other mental 
disorders seems to be of relevance. Disease specific SGT patterns can function as state markers, 
which can be utilized to monitor disease progression and more importantly therapeutic changes 
and shifts towards more adaptive SGTs. Mapping disease specific SGT patterns, could be also 
further helpful for diagnostic purposes. As decreased positive valence of SGT was most 
representative of the depressive mind, one could envision how therapies fostering selfcompassion and positive affect might be particularly useful for clinical interventions (Van Dam 
et al., 2011). In addition mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to be very effective in 
treating depression, by increasing momentary positive emotions and reward experience (e.g. 
Geschwind et al., 2011) and decreasing negative mind wandering in terms of ruminative thinking 
(e.g. Ramel et al., 2004). For future studies it would be interesting to compare SGT patterns 
between different mental disorders. Naturally, investigating SGT patterns in anxiety disorders 
relative to depression would be very interesting, particularly as there exists a high comorbidity 
between these two disorders. It could be assumed that the SGT pattern of anxiety disorders 
relative to MDD shift more strongly in the temporal domain towards future, representing 
pathological worry, while being possibly equally negative and self focused. Additionally it 
would be interesting to explore how SGT patterns change in remission from depression.
Investigating SGT “online” with tasks such as the CRT combined with assessment of the 
different thought content dimensions, as used in this study could represent a more objective 
measure than clinical interviews and self-reports. Particularly self-reports demand certain
amount of retrospection and introspection, which are often deficient in many mental disorders.
4.5. Limitations
One limitation of the present study is that no other measures of rumination and worry were 
available to relate these to the SGT pattern in depression, and strongly validate the interpretation 
of rumination and worry. In addition the study was based on a relatively small sample size.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion this study aimed to investigate the specific contents of online SGTs and 
their variability in depression. The findings show that MDD patients engaged in more SGTs than 
healthy controls that was seemingly ruminative in nature, being more negative and less positive
in valence as well as more self- and past related. Particularly in the temporal domain, MDD 
patients’ thoughts about the past and the future were more negatively valenced. The decreased 
positive valence of SGTs was the best predictor for depression. Additionally the variability in 
SGTs related negatively to symptom severity in depression. Investigating different SGT patterns 
of mental disorders such as depression using event-sampling online measures can be useful for 
deriving state markers that may help diagnosis and intervention.

 Probing self-generated thought (SGT) patterns and their variability in depression.
 Online assessment of thoughts using an experience sampling method.
 Depressed patients showed a specific SGT pattern related to symptom severity.
 Depressive SGTs were more negative, less positive, more self-and past-related.
 SGT variability decreased with increasing symptom severity in depression.
